# OutlookAttachments
A solution I wrote to solve a simple problem. Outlook allows one to save many attachments in an email at once, but what if uou needed to save multiple attachments across different emails?
This VBA script is designed to save attachments from selected emails in Microsoft Outlook to a specific folder in the user's "My Documents" directory.
